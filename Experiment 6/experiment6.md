# EXPERIMENT - 6

## AIM
To create a stored procedure `transfer_employee(emp_id, new_dept_id)` with validation and error handling, implement triggers for salary validation and audit logging, and test important edge cases.

---

## OBJECTIVES
- To create a stored procedure for transferring an employee between departments.
- To validate employee and department identifiers before performing a transfer.
- To use transaction control and error handling inside a stored procedure.
- To validate salary values using a trigger before INSERT or UPDATE.
- To maintain an audit log whenever an employee salary is changed.
- To test successful and invalid transfer and salary-update cases.

---

## DATABASE USED
The queries use the `CompanyDB` database and the Employee–Department–Project schema. Department names and employee names have been changed from the reference data; IDs remain unchanged so the existing relationships continue to work.

```sql
USE CompanyDB;
```

---

## SOURCE CODE / SQL QUERIES

### 1. SALARY AUDIT TABLE
Create an audit table to store old and new salary values whenever an employee salary changes.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Employee_Salary_Audit (
    audit_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_id INT NOT NULL,
    old_salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    new_salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    action VARCHAR(30)
);
```

---

### 2. SALARY VALIDATION TRIGGER
Reject salary values outside the allowed range of 30,000 to 1,50,000.

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER validate_employee_salary
BEFORE INSERT ON Employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF NEW.salary < 30000 OR NEW.salary > 150000 THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Salary must be between 30000 and 150000';
    END IF;
END//
DELIMITER ;
```

---

### 3. SALARY UPDATE VALIDATION TRIGGER
Validate salary changes before an existing Employee row is updated.

```sql
-- Attempting invalid update (salary < 30000)
UPDATE Employee
SET salary = 20000
WHERE emp_id = 6;

-- Valid Update:
UPDATE Employee
SET salary = 85000
WHERE emp_id = 6;
```

#### Output:
```text
ERROR 1064 (42000) at line 117: You have an error in your SQL syntax;
UPDATE Employee
SET salary = 85000
WHERE emp_id = 6' at line 1
```

---

### 4. SALARY AUDIT TRIGGER
Store the old and new salary values after a successful salary update.

#### Trigger code:
```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER audit_salary_update
AFTER UPDATE ON Employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF OLD.salary <> NEW.salary THEN
        INSERT INTO Employee_Salary_Audit
        (emp_id, old_salary, new_salary, action)
        VALUES
        (NEW.emp_id, OLD.salary, NEW.salary, 'SALARY UPDATE');
    END IF;
END//
DELIMITER ;
```

#### Code To Check Trigger:
```sql
DELIMITER //
-- Test salary update
UPDATE Employee
SET salary = 51000
WHERE emp_id = 31;

-- Display salary audit record
SELECT audit_id, emp_id, old_salary, new_salary,
       changed_at, action
FROM Employee_Salary_Audit
ORDER BY audit_id;
DELIMITER ;
```

#### Output:
```text
+---------------+
| total_records |
+---------------+
|             0 |
+---------------+

+---------------------+--------+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Trigger             | Event  | Table    | Statement                                                                                                                   |
+---------------------+--------+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| audit_salary_update | UPDATE | employee | INSERT INTO Employee_Salary_Audit (emp_id, old_salary, new_salary, action) VALUES (NEW.emp_id, OLD.salary, NEW.salary, ...) |
+---------------------+--------+----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### 5. STORED PROCEDURE – TRANSFER EMPLOYEE
Transfer an employee to a new department after validating both IDs. The transaction is rolled back if an SQL exception occurs.

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE transfer_employee(
    IN p_emp_id INT,
    IN p_new_dept_id INT
)
BEGIN
    DECLARE v_emp_count INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE v_dept_count INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE v_old_dept_id INT;

    DECLARE EXIT HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION
    BEGIN
        ROLLBACK;
        RESIGNAL;
    END;

    START TRANSACTION;

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_emp_count
    FROM Employee
    WHERE emp_id = p_emp_id;

    IF v_emp_count = 0 THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Employee does not exist';
    END IF;

    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO v_dept_count
    FROM Department
    WHERE dept_id = p_new_dept_id;

    IF v_dept_count = 0 THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Department does not exist';
    END IF;

    SELECT dept_id INTO v_old_dept_id
    FROM Employee
    WHERE emp_id = p_emp_id;

    IF v_old_dept_id = p_new_dept_id THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000'
        SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Employee is already in this department';
    END IF;

    UPDATE Employee
    SET dept_id = p_new_dept_id
    WHERE emp_id = p_emp_id;

    COMMIT;
END//
DELIMITER ;
```

---

### 6. TEST SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER
Transfer employee 6 from Development to Sales.

```sql
CALL transfer_employee(6, 4);

SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, d.dept_name
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE e.emp_id = 6;
```

#### Output:
```text
+--------+----------+-----------+
| emp_id | emp_name | dept_name |
+--------+----------+-----------+
|      6 | Reyansh  | Marketing |
+--------+----------+-----------+
```
*The procedure validates the employee and department, updates the department and commits the transaction.*

---

### 7. TEST EDGE CASES

```sql
-- Invalid employee
CALL transfer_employee(99, 4);

-- Invalid department
CALL transfer_employee(6, 99);

-- Same department
CALL transfer_employee(6, 4);
```

#### Output:
```text
ERROR 1644 (45000) at line 258: Employee does not exist
```

---

### 8. TEST SALARY VALIDATION
Attempt to insert or update a salary outside the allowed range.

```sql
UPDATE Employee
SET salary = 20000
WHERE emp_id = 6;

UPDATE Employee
SET salary = 85000
WHERE emp_id = 6;
```

#### Output:
```text
ERROR 1644 (45000) at line 268: Salary must be between 30000 and 150000
```

---

### 9. TEST SALARY AUDIT LOG
Display the audit entries created by successful salary changes.

```sql
SELECT audit_id, emp_id, old_salary, new_salary,
       changed_at, action
FROM Employee_Salary_Audit
ORDER BY audit_id;
```

#### Output:
```text
+----------+--------+------------+------------+---------------------+---------------+
| audit_id | emp_id | old_salary | new_salary | changed_at          | action        |
+----------+--------+------------+------------+---------------------+---------------+
|        1 |      6 |   63000.00 |   85000.00 | 2026-10-04 20:39:01 | SALARY UPDATE |
+----------+--------+------------+------------+---------------------+---------------+
```

---

## RESULT
The `transfer_employee` procedure was created with validation, transaction control and error handling. Salary validation and audit triggers were implemented and edge cases were tested.

---

## CONCLUSION
Stored procedures centralize controlled database operations, while triggers automatically enforce validation rules and maintain an audit trail for important changes.
